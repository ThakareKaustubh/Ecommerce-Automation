Author: Kaustubh Thakare

An end-to-end automation framework for testing an e-commerce web application using Selenium WebDriver, Pytest, and the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern. This framework supports scalable test development, integrates with Jenkins for CI/CD, and generates detailed Allure Reports for test results.


**📌 FEATURES**

1. Modular Test Design: Implements the Page Object Model for maintainable and reusable code.

2. Test Coverage: Includes test cases for user registration, login, logout, product search, cart operations, and checkout processes.

3. Reporting: Integrates Allure for comprehensive and visually appealing test reports.

4. CI/CD Integration: Configured with Jenkins for automated test execution in continuous integration pipelines.

5. Configuration Management: Utilizes pytest.ini and config/ directory for managing test configurations and environment settings.
